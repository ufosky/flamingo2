Looks like I bit off a bit more than I can chew. Again. There's some cool stuff in this project, so I'll probably come back to it later. For now, I'm going to work on a few less ambitious game projects.

Currently compiles only on Mac OS X (tested on 10.6 and 10.7)

Dependencies:
-------------

physicsfs: <http://icculus.org/physfs/><br />
DevIL: <http://openil.sourceforge.net/><br />
SDL: <http://www.libsdl.org/> (Download OS X .dmg, place SDL.framework in /Library/Frameworks/)<br />
swig: <http://www.swig.org>
Python 2.7.3: <http://www.python.org>

Everything should work if you install everything but SDL with Homebrew (except Python). There might be some path errors in Xcode, but they're fairly easy to fix.
